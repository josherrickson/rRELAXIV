# Reference for RELAX-IV Algorithm

The **rrelaxiv** package implements D. P. Bertsekas and P. Tseng's RELAX-IV
algorithm and code:

- Bersekas, D. P. and Tseng, P., "Relaxation Methods for Minimum Cost ..."
  Operations Research, vol. 26, 1988, 93-114
- Bertsekas, D. P., "An Auction/Sequential Shortest Path Algorithm for the
  Minimum Cost Flow Problem", LIDS Report P-2146, MIT, Nov. 1992
- Bertsekas, D.P., Linear Network Optimization, MIT Press, 1991
- Bertsekas, D.P., Network Optimization: Continuous and Discrete Models, Athena
  Scientific, 1998; <http://web.mit.edu/dimitrib/www/noc.htm>

Bertsekas and Tseng freely permit their software to be used for research
purposes, but non-research uses, including the use of it to 'satisfy in any part
commercial delivery requirements to government or industry,' require a special
agreement with them. By extension, this requirement applies to most any use of R
functions in the **rrelaxiv** package.
